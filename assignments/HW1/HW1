Excersice 4: Normalizing number transliterations
a)

Pro:
With the lack of a final state, the Mealy Machines can be used to interpret any lenght and form of inputs
And the fact that the machines are deterministic means that always the same output will be generated for the same input. 

Con:
Because the Mealy Machines are deterministic, it also means that all the Meanly Machines need to be written out comepletly. 
No checks can be done with a final state to see if a word is valid

b)
